# RISC-V RV32I Datapath RTL Design (Ongoing)

## Project Status
🚧 This is an ongoing group project as part of M.Tech coursework.
This repository contains the **datapath design** handled by me.

## Overview
This project focuses on the RTL design of the **datapath** of a
single-cycle RISC-V RV32I processor. The control unit and memory
subsystems are handled by other team members.

## My Contribution
- RTL design of RISC-V datapath
- ALU implementation
- Register file design
- Immediate generator
- Integration of datapath modules

## Architecture
The datapath supports RV32I instructions including:
- R-type
- I-type
- Load/Store
- Branch instructions

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- ModelSim / QuestaSim (for simulation)

## Current Progress
- Datapath block-level design completed
- RTL coding in progress
- Unit-level verification ongoing

## Planned Work
- Integration with control unit
- Full SoC synthesis
- Timing analysis
